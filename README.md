# First-Come-First-Serve

## What is FCFS?

First come first serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according to their arrival time. The job which comes first in the ready queue will get the CPU first. This algorithm is a Non-preemptive Scheduling the main reason is because it not interrupt a process running CPU in the middle of the execution. Instead, it waits till the process completes its CPU burst time, and then it can allocate the CPU to another process.
